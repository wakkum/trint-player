# Trint Interactive Transcript Player

## Distribution package

If you wish to use *trint-player* as it is, just grab the distribuition package located in `dist/*` — you’ll find the bundle there, including the minified `trint-player.min.js`.

## Running local copy

Should you wish to fiddle with the source code, `src/*` is your playground: `$ cd` project directory run `$ make` and launch `static/index.html` in the browser.
